<!-- Verification debt (Phase 0 table VD-a…VD-g) closes here, each with the source actually consulted. -->

## 2026-09-09 · VD-a closed: `zip` major version confirmed as 8.x · Phase 0
Context: Phase 0 acceptance A0.9 requires VD-a (TECHNOLOGY_EVALUATION §14.1 / V2 §9) to close before
`zip` is pinned in the workspace manifest — V2 reported 8.6.0 from a single source and flagged the jump
from the previously assumed 0.42 for manual spot-check.
Decision: pin `zip = "8.6"` as the plan specifies (§1.2). No change.
Evidence: crates.io sparse index `https://index.crates.io/3/z/zip`, read 2026-09-09. Full stable
release order ends `… 8.4.0, 8.5.0, 8.5.1, 8.6.0`; the only higher versions are `9.0.0-pre1/-pre2/-pre3`,
which are pre-releases and not selectable by a `"8.6"` requirement. 8.6.0 is therefore the current
stable major, and V2's number is confirmed against the registry itself.
Affects: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §1.2, Phase 0 VD-a, Phase 5 (`oc-epub` deterministic zip).

## 2026-09-09 · `pdfium-render` 0.9.4 feature names corrected · Phase 0
Context: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §1.2 pins `pdfium-render = { version = "0.9.4", default-features = false,
features = ["image", "libloading"] }`. Neither feature exists; `cargo generate-lockfile` refuses the
manifest ("`pdfium-render` does not have these features").
Decision: use `features = ["pdfium_latest", "image_025", "thread_safe"]`.
Evidence: the crates.io index entry for `pdfium-render` 0.9.4 declares `default = ["pdfium_latest",
"image_latest", "thread_safe"]`, `image_025 = ["dep:image_025", "image_api"]`, and lists `libloading ^0`
as a *non-optional* dependency for `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))`. Runtime binding via
`Pdfium::bind_to_library` (D3) therefore needs no feature at all, and the image API is reached through
`image_025`, which matches the workspace `image = "0.25"` pin. `pdfium_latest` will be replaced by the
exact `pdfium_<build>` feature matching the vendored `bblanchon/pdfium-binaries` release when
`xtask vendor-pdfium` pins it (Phase 0 implementation detail 1).
Affects: D3, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §1.2, `crates/oc-pdf`.

## 2026-09-09 · Pinned Rust toolchain moved 1.85.0 → 1.88.0 · Phase 0
Context: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §1.3 pins `channel = "1.85.0"`, with the stated rationale that *pinning*
(not that particular number) keeps `clippy -D warnings` stable. The plan's own V2-verified dependency
pins cannot be built by 1.85.0.
Decision: pin `1.88.0` — the lowest toolchain that builds the dependency set §1.2 specifies — in
`rust-toolchain.toml`, `[workspace.package] rust-version`, and the three `ci.yml` toolchain steps.
Evidence: `cargo generate-lockfile` on the §1.2 dependency set reports MSRVs above 1.85 for
`zip 8.6.0` (1.88), `lopdf 0.45.0` (1.88), `image 0.25.10` (1.88), `libloading 0.9.0` (1.88),
`time 0.3.55` (1.88), `weezl 0.2.1` (1.88), `wasip2` (1.87), `quick-xml 0.42.0` (1.86),
`multiversion 0.9.0` (1.86); the maximum is 1.88.0.
Affects: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §1.2/§1.3/§1.9. DECISIONS.md does not name a Rust version (D1), so no ADR
decision is contradicted.

## 2026-09-09 · RT B1 substitution recorded: no `has_unicode_map_error()` · Phase 0
Context: D3's residual-risk note and Phase 0 implementation detail 3 require a one-paragraph note here
recording what replaces `has_unicode_map_error()`, which V2 could not find in `pdfium-render`.
Decision: `BrokenText` classification never calls it. Phase 0 detects broken CMaps from the
U+FFFD + PUA share of visible characters against `pageclass.broken_text_replacement_share` (0.20);
Phase 2 adds the second arm, dictionary hit rate against `pageclass.broken_text_dict_hit_min` (0.35),
which `classify_page` already accepts as `Option<f32>` and Phase 0 passes as `None`.
Evidence: V2 §1 (API-name verification), RT B1, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN Phase 0 detail 3 and failure-mode
table. To be re-confirmed against the vendored PDFium headers when `xtask vendor-pdfium` lands.
Affects: D3, `crates/oc-pdf/src/classify.rs`, thresholds `pageclass.broken_text_*`.

## 2026-09-09 · `webpki-roots` licence blocks `ureq` under D15's allow-list · Phase 0 (flagged for Phase 9)
Context: bootstrapping `oc-net` with `ureq = { version = "3", features = ["rustls"] }` (§1.2) makes
`cargo deny check licenses` fail: `webpki-roots 1.0.9` is `CDLA-Permissive-2.0`, which is not on D15's
allow-list (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3, ISC, MPL-2.0, Unicode, Zlib, CC0).
Decision: Phase 0 does not implement `oc-net` (Phase 0 scope excludes all network code), so the `ureq`
dependency is not declared yet; the manifest carries a comment pointing here. `cargo deny check` is
clean at bootstrap. The choice is deferred to Phase 9, which owns model downloads, and is one of:
(a) source TLS roots from the platform verifier / `rustls-native-certs` instead of `webpki-roots`;
(b) a `deny.toml` `[licenses] exceptions` entry scoped to `webpki-roots` with an issue link;
(c) amend D15's allow-list with `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` — an ADR change, which would mean stopping and
asking rather than deciding in-phase.
Evidence: `cargo deny check licenses` on the bootstrap graph:
`error[rejected] webpki-roots-1.0.9/Cargo.toml:26 license = "CDLA-Permissive-2.0" — not explicitly allowed`.
Affects: D15, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §1.2/§1.4, `crates/oc-net`, Phase 9.

## 2026-09-09 · Intra-workspace path dependencies carry explicit versions · Phase 0
Context: `deny.toml` sets `wildcards = "deny"` (§1.4). A `{ path = "../oc-model" }` dependency with no
version requirement is a wildcard, so `cargo deny check bans` failed on all eleven internal crates.
Decision: every internal path dependency is written `{ path = "…", version = "0.1.0" }`.
Evidence: `cargo deny check bans` — `error[wildcard]: found 1 wildcard dependency for crate 'oc-core'`
before the change; `bans ok` after.
Affects: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §1.4, every `crates/*/Cargo.toml`.
